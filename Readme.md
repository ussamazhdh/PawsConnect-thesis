## 🐾 About PawConnect

**PawConnect** is a web-based pet adoption platform designed to connect animals in need with responsible adopters in a transparent and ethical manner. The platform enables users to browse animals available for adoption, report missing pets, and support animal welfare initiatives through voluntary donations.

The project is built on the principle that animals should **never be treated as commercial products**. PawConnect promotes adoption over buying and selling, eliminating monetary transactions related to pet ownership and focusing instead on compassion, responsibility, and community support.

This project was developed as part of **Therap Java Fest 2022** and later extended for academic and portfolio purposes.
