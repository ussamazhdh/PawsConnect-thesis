1. Go to the project folder in Git Bash

Open Git Bash, then run:

cd /c/Users/oussama/Downloads/adoptapaw-therap-master
ls


You should see something like:

backend  frontend  README.md  ...


If you get No such file or directory, check spelling and capitalization.

2. Run the backend (Spring Boot)

From the project root:

cd backend
ls


You should see mvnw, pom.xml, src, etc.

2.1 Try to start the backend with Maven wrapper

In Git Bash:

./mvnw spring-boot:run


If you get a permission error (Permission denied), run:

chmod +x mvnw
./mvnw spring-boot:run


If you get an error like 'java' is not recognized or Java version issues, tell me the exact message and I will help you fix it.

Leave this Git Bash window running; the backend will stay attached to it on port 8080.

3. Run the frontend (React)

Open a second Git Bash window.

Go again to the project:

cd /c/Users/oussama/Downloads/adoptapaw-therap-master
cd frontend
ls


You should see package.json.

3.1 Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install


Wait for it to finish without errors.

3.2 Start the frontend
npm start


This should open the app in your browser at:

http://localhost:3000

The frontend will talk to the backend at http://localhost:8080 (which is running in the first Git Bash window).
